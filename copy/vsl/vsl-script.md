## STEP 1: HOOK + EARLY CTA
[Timestamp: 0:00 - 1:30]
[Word count: ~200 words]

If you run a business and you're doing most of the work yourself, this is the most important video you'll watch this year.

Here's what we do. We build custom AI agent systems, train them on YOUR business, YOUR SOPs, YOUR workflows. Then we install the whole thing into your operations. Marketing, sales, fulfillment. All of it.

The result? One person outputs what used to take five to ten people. Without hiring. Without contractors. Without burning out.

And before I tell you how it works, I want to be straight with you. Most AI content online is surface level. Prompt lists. ChatGPT screenshots. Tutorials that leave you with a folder of bookmarks and nothing to show for it.

This is different. We don't teach you AI theory. We build you a system and install it inside your business in less than five days.

If you already know this is what you need, the button's right below this video. You can get started right now. $5,000, payment plans available, 60-day ROI guarantee.

If you want to see exactly how it works and why it's worth every dollar, keep watching.

## STEP 2: CREDIBILITY / INTRODUCTION
[Timestamp: 1:30 - 3:00]
[Word count: ~200 words]

My name is Kabrin Johal. I'm the founder of Crafted Marketing, a high-ticket marketing agency in the education and info product space.

Before that, I opened and operated 11 Orange Theory Fitness franchise locations. Managed over 200 staff across those locations. Exited in 2020. Went online. Started with dropshipping, pivoted to high-ticket dropshipping, sold that operation to a Las Vegas hotel chain.

April 2024, I launched the agency. And from day one, I built the entire fulfillment engine on AI agents. Every client deliverable. Every campaign. Every funnel. All of it runs through the system you'd be getting.

The page you're on right now? Built with this system. The copy on it? Written with this system. The funnel behind it? Same system.

My co-founder is Elijah Bricker. He's 21. Skipped college. Sold over $10 million in commercial real estate in two years. Built Arbory LLC and generated over $1 million in revenue for business owners in 14 months. His entire business runs closed-loop automated.

Between the two of us, $4 million plus in revenue. And we soft launched AI Drivers to a small group. $36,000 generated, $14,500 cash collected, before we even ran a single ad.

## STEP 3: THE STORY / ORIGIN
[Timestamp: 3:00 - 4:15]
[Word count: ~175 words]

Here's how AI Drivers started.

When I launched Crafted Marketing, I had a problem. I was getting clients, but I couldn't fulfill fast enough. Hiring was slow. Contractors were inconsistent. And I was doing 80% of the work myself.

So I started building AI agents. Not chatbots. Not prompt templates. Actual systems. Agents with skills, SOPs, automation, quality control. A full operating layer for my business.

Within a few months, I was producing what used to take a team of five to ten people. Client research, sales copy, landing pages, email sequences, ad scripts, webinar scripts, funnel builds. All running through structured AI workflows.

Then the realization hit me. This isn't just a tool for my agency. This is a product. Because every business owner I talk to has the same problem. They're maxed out on output. They can't scale without hiring. And they've tried AI, but all they got was a glorified chatbot.

That's why we built AI Drivers. To take what works for us and install it into your business.

## STEP 4: THE PROBLEM + FALSE SOLUTION
[Timestamp: 4:15 - 5:30]
[Word count: ~200 words]

Let me guess where you are right now.

You've used ChatGPT. Maybe you bought a course. Maybe you spent a weekend watching YouTube tutorials and ended up with a bunch of prompts that don't connect to anything.

And nothing actually changed. You're still doing the same work the same way. Still limited by the hours in your day.

Here's the thing most people get wrong. They think AI is about prompting better. It's not. It's about building systems.

A prompt is a one-off question. A system is a trained agent that knows your business, follows your process, and produces output at your standard. Every single time.

The problem is that AI agents live in the tech world right now. Engineers build them for engineers. If you're a business owner, a consultant, an agency operator, there's no pathway for you. Nobody is building this for the people who actually need it.

That's the gap we fill. AI Drivers is the bridge between the tech world and business owners who want AI agents working across their marketing, sales, and operations. We take the technology, make it practical, and plug it into your business so it actually produces revenue.

## [LIVE DEMO]
[Timestamp: 5:30 - 7:00]
[Length: ~1-2 minutes]

Let me stop talking about it and just show you. This is Crafted Marketing, my agency. These are real client deliverables. Watch what happens when I run the system.

*(Kabrin records live demo: screen share of the system in action. Show the command launching, deliverables being pulled up, the output quality. Keep it tight. 1-2 minutes max. Walk through what the viewer would be getting built for their business.)*

That's what you'd be getting. Custom-built for your business, your workflows, your standards. Now let me walk you through everything that's included.

## STEP 6: GUARANTEE + OBJECTIONS
[Timestamp: 8:00 - 8:45]
[Word count: ~150 words]

And here's the guarantee. If the system doesn't generate or save you at least $5,000 in 60 days, we keep working with you for free until it does.

Let me handle the four things you're probably thinking right now.

"I'm not technical." You don't need to be. We build it. We install it. We configure your entire workspace. If you can use a computer and get on a video call, you have enough technical skill.

"Will this actually work for my business?" That's what the assessment is for. We don't guess. We map your operations first and build specifically for your workflows.

"Can I just do this on my own?" Honestly, yes. You can try. But here's what people find out. We've spent the last year of our lives, three to four hours a day, doing nothing but learning AI and building agents that actually execute real business tasks. Most people who go the solo route end up with agents that produce mediocre output. And that's because they don't know how to properly train them. The prompting, the SOPs, the feedback loops, the quality control. That's the part nobody teaches you. That's exactly where we come in.

"Is $5,000 worth it?" Run the math. If the system saves you 10 hours a week and your time is worth $50 an hour, that's $2,000 a month. $6,000 in 90 days. One new client at $5,000 covers the entire investment on its own.

## STEP 7: QUALIFY + FINAL CTA
[Timestamp: 8:45 - 9:15]
[Word count: ~100 words]

This is for you if you're a business owner with real revenue who wants to scale without adding headcount. You're willing to show up for calls and commit about three hours a week to learning the system.

This is not for you if you don't have a business yet, you're looking for something that runs on autopilot with zero effort, or you won't engage with the process.

If this is you, click the button below this video and get started. $5,000. Payment plans available. 60-day ROI guarantee. We build it, install it, and stay in your corner for six months.

## Production Notes

### On-Screen Text Callouts
- **0:00** - "AI Systems That Make You Rich" (match landing page headline)
- **1:30** - "Kabrin Johal | Founder, Crafted Marketing" (name/title lower third)
- **2:40** - "Elijah Bricker | Co-Founder, 21" (name/title lower third)
- **2:50** - "$4M+ combined revenue" (metric callout)
- **5:30** - "LIVE DEMO: Crafted Marketing" (lower third during demo)
- **7:00** - Stack each offer item as text on screen as Kabrin reads them (numbered list appearing one by one)
- **7:50** - "$31,300+ total value" crossed out, "$5,000" highlighted
- **8:00** - "60-Day ROI Guarantee" (bold, centered)
- **8:45** - "Click Below to Get Started" with arrow pointing down

### B-Roll / Visual Suggestions
- **Steps 1-2:** Kabrin to camera, clean background, good lighting. No fancy set. Professional but not produced.
- **Step 3:** Consider brief screen recordings of the AI system in action (Claude Code interface, deliverables being generated) as quick cutaway B-roll
- **Demo (5:30-7:00):** Full screen recording of the system. Kabrin narrates over it. Show the command launching, deliverables appearing, output quality. This is the strongest proof moment in the video.
- **Step 5:** Stack items could appear as animated text overlay while Kabrin speaks, or use a simple slide/card format
- **Step 6:** Guarantee text on screen reinforces the spoken words

### Pacing Notes
- Steps 1-4 are conversational. Talk like you're explaining this to a friend at dinner. Not presenting. Not selling. Just telling them what this is.
- The demo is the energy shift. You stop talking and start showing. Keep it tight, narrate what's on screen, don't over-explain. Let the output speak for itself.
- Step 5 picks up pace slightly. This is a list. Move through it with confidence. Don't linger on each item. The demo already showed them it's real, now you're just naming what's included.
- Steps 6-7 are direct and final. No hesitation. You believe in this. Land the close clean.
- The whole script should feel like Kabrin is having a one-on-one conversation, not reading a teleprompter. Memorize the beats, not the exact words. Natural delivery matters more than word-perfect recitation.

### Recording Tips
- Record in one take if possible. Cuts make it feel produced. This should feel real.
- If using a teleprompter, set the scroll speed slow enough that eye movement isn't visible
- Camera at eye level. Look directly into the lens. This is a conversation with one person.
- Audio quality matters more than video quality. Use a good mic.
