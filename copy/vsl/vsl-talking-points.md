## Slide 1 - "AI Systems That Make You Rich"
**On screen:** Title + "AI Drivers" label + subtitle

**Say this:**
If you run a business and you're doing most of the work yourself, this is the most important video you'll watch this year.

---

## Slide 2 - "Build. Train. Install."
**On screen:** 3 bullet points (build, train, install)

**Say this:**
Here's what we do. We build custom AI agent systems, train them on YOUR business, YOUR SOPs, YOUR workflows. Then we install the whole thing into your operations. Marketing, sales, fulfillment. All of it.

---

## Slide 3 - "1 = 5-10"
**On screen:** Big number visual + "without hiring, contractors, burning out"

**Say this:**
The result? One person outputs what used to take five to ten people. Without hiring. Without contractors. Without burning out.

---

## Slide 4 - "This Is Different"
**On screen:** Two cards comparing "Most AI Content" vs "AI Drivers"

**Say this:**
And before I tell you how it works, I want to be straight with you. Most AI content online is surface level. Prompt lists. ChatGPT screenshots. Tutorials that leave you with a folder of bookmarks and nothing to show for it.

This is different. We don't teach you AI theory. We build you a system and install it inside your business in less than five days.

If you already know this is what you need, the button's right below this video. You can get started right now. $5,000, payment plans available, 60-day ROI guarantee.

If you want to see exactly how it works and why it's worth every dollar, keep watching.

## Slide 5 - "Kabrin Johal"
**On screen:** Name, title, credential pills (11 OTF locations, 200+ staff, exited 2020, agency on AI)

**Say this:**
My name is Kabrin Johal. I'm the founder of Crafted Marketing, a high-ticket marketing agency in the education and info product space.

Before that, I opened and operated 11 Orange Theory Fitness franchise locations. Managed over 200 staff across those locations. Exited in 2020. Went online. Started with dropshipping, pivoted to high-ticket dropshipping, sold that operation to a Las Vegas hotel chain.

April 2024, I launched the agency. And from day one, I built the entire fulfillment engine on AI agents. Every client deliverable. Every campaign. Every funnel. All of it runs through the system you'd be getting.

The page you're on right now? Built with this system. The copy on it? Written with this system. The funnel behind it? Same system.

---

## Slide 6 - "Elijah Bricker"
**On screen:** Name, title, credential pills ($10M+ real estate, Arbory LLC, $1M+ revenue)

**Say this:**
My co-founder is Elijah Bricker. He's 21. Skipped college. Sold over $10 million in commercial real estate in two years. Built Arbory LLC and generated over $1 million in revenue for business owners in 14 months. His entire business runs closed-loop automated.

---

## Slide 7 - "The Numbers"
**On screen:** $4M+ counter, $36K generated, $14.5K cash collected, "before a single ad"

**Say this:**
Between the two of us, $4 million plus in revenue. And we soft launched AI Drivers to a small group. $36,000 generated, $14,500 cash collected, before we even ran a single ad.

---

## Slide 8 - "How AI Drivers Started"
**On screen:** 3 story cards (The Problem, The Solution, The Result)

**Say this:**
Here's how AI Drivers started.

When I launched Crafted Marketing, I had a problem. I was getting clients, but I couldn't fulfill fast enough. Hiring was slow. Contractors were inconsistent. And I was doing 80% of the work myself.

So I started building AI agents. Not chatbots. Not prompt templates. Actual systems. Agents with skills, SOPs, automation, quality control. A full operating layer for my business.

Within a few months, I was producing what used to take a team of five to ten people. Client research, sales copy, landing pages, email sequences, ad scripts, webinar scripts, funnel builds. All running through structured AI workflows.

---

## Slide 9 - "The Realization"
**On screen:** "This isn't just a tool. It's a product." + supporting text

**Say this:**
Then the realization hit me. This isn't just a tool for my agency. This is a product. Because every business owner I talk to has the same problem. They're maxed out on output. They can't scale without hiring. And they've tried AI, but all they got was a glorified chatbot.

That's why we built AI Drivers. To take what works for us and install it into your business.

---

## Slide 10 - "Sound Familiar?"
**On screen:** ChatGPT, Courses, YouTube tutorials, prompts, "Nothing actually changed."

**Say this:**
Let me guess where you are right now.

You've used ChatGPT. Maybe you bought a course. Maybe you spent a weekend watching YouTube tutorials and ended up with a bunch of prompts that don't connect to anything.

And nothing actually changed. You're still doing the same work the same way. Still limited by the hours in your day.

---

## Slide 11 - "Prompts vs. Systems"
**On screen:** Two-column comparison. "A Prompt" (dim) vs "A System" (glowing)

**Say this:**
Here's the thing most people get wrong. They think AI is about prompting better. It's not. It's about building systems.

A prompt is a one-off question. A system is a trained agent that knows your business, follows your process, and produces output at your standard. Every single time.

---

## Slide 12 - "The Gap"
**On screen:** 4 gap items with X marks

**Say this:**
The problem is that AI agents live in the tech world right now. Engineers build them for engineers. If you're a business owner, a consultant, an agency operator, there's no pathway for you. Nobody is building this for the people who actually need it.

---

## Slide 13 - "We Are The Bridge"
**On screen:** Tech World ← AI DRIVERS → Business Owners (bridge animates)

**Say this:**
That's the gap we fill. AI Drivers is the bridge between the tech world and business owners who want AI agents working across their marketing, sales, and operations. We take the technology, make it practical, and plug it into your business so it actually produces revenue.

---

## Slide 14 - "Let Me Show You"
**On screen:** "Crafted Marketing. Real deliverables. Live." + "SWITCH TO DEMO NOW" cue

**Say this:**
Let me stop talking about it and just show you. This is Crafted Marketing, my agency. These are real client deliverables. Watch what happens when I run the system.

**[SWITCH TO DEMO IN SCREEN STUDIO]**

Record 1-2 minutes showing the system in action. Walk through what the viewer would be getting built for their business. Keep it tight. Narrate what's on screen.

**When demo is done, say:**
That's what you'd be getting. Custom-built for your business, your workflows, your standards. Now let me walk you through everything that's included.

---

## Slide 16 - "Your Investment"
**On screen:** $31,300+ crossed out, $5,000 price, 3 payment options

**Say this:**
Total value: over $31,000.

Your investment: $5,000. Payment plans available. $2,500 for two months or $1,667 for three months.

---

## Slide 17 - "60-Day ROI Guarantee"
**On screen:** Shield visual + guarantee text

**Say this:**
And here's the guarantee. If the system doesn't generate or save you at least $5,000 in 60 days, we keep working with you for free until it does.

---

## Slide 18 - "4 Things You're Thinking"
**On screen:** 4 objection cards (press spacebar to flip each one)

**Say this:**
Let me handle the four things you're probably thinking right now.

**[SPACEBAR to flip card 1]** "I'm not technical." You don't need to be. We build it. We install it. We configure your entire workspace. If you can use a computer and get on a video call, you have enough technical skill.

**[SPACEBAR to flip card 2]** "Will this actually work for my business?" That's what the assessment is for. We don't guess. We map your operations first and build specifically for your workflows.

**[SPACEBAR to flip card 3]** "Can I just do this on my own?" Honestly, yes. You can try. But here's what people find out. We've spent the last year of our lives, three to four hours a day, doing nothing but learning AI and building agents that actually execute real business tasks. Most people who go the solo route end up with agents that produce mediocre output. And that's because they don't know how to properly train them. The prompting, the SOPs, the feedback loops, the quality control. That's the part nobody teaches you. That's exactly where we come in.

**[SPACEBAR to flip card 4]** "Is $5,000 worth it?" Run the math. If the system saves you 10 hours a week and your time is worth $50 an hour, that's $2,000 a month. $6,000 in 90 days. One new client at $5,000 covers the entire investment on its own.

---

## Slide 19 - "Is This For You?"
**On screen:** Two columns. Green checkmarks (for you) vs red X marks (not for you)

**Say this:**
This is for you if you're a business owner with real revenue who wants to scale without adding headcount. You're willing to show up for calls and commit about three hours a week to learning the system.

This is not for you if you don't have a business yet, you're looking for something that runs on autopilot with zero effort, or you won't engage with the process.

---

## Slide 20 - "Get Started"
**On screen:** $5,000 CTA button + guarantee + "6 months" line

**Say this:**
If this is you, click the button below this video and get started. $5,000. Payment plans available. 60-day ROI guarantee. We build it, install it, and stay in your corner for six months.
